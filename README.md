# Stress testing with a Python Script

Stress testing helps you to find a counter  test case for your wrong answer solutions. 

- You need to have mingw and python both added to your environment variables

``generator.cpp`` Write your own generator based on the problem statement

``fast_solution.cpp`` This is the solution giving a wrong answer and you don't know why

``bruteforce.cpp`` This is a slow solution but giving 100% correct output



## To run the stress testing:

``py stress.py``
